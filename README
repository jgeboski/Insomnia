An android application for keeping the screen of a device awake.

## Building

The application uses the gradle build tool, which must be installed on
the system before building the application.

Begin by checking out the source tree:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/Insomnia.git
    $ cd Insomnia

Now invoke the build process with gradle:

    $ gradle assembleDebug

The APK will now reside at `app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk`.
